							<p>Down &amp; Derby, our 7th annual community fundraiser spearheaded by Laura Ladd, will be happening on May 7th and we've got a whole new game plan this year. We are excited to announce we&apos;re hosting this year's Kentucky Derby themed fundraiser at the beautiful <a href="http://www.serafinaboston.com/">Serafina</a>. </p>
							<p>Proceeds from this event are to benefit <a href="http://www.respondinc.org/">RESPOND</a>, New England's first domestic violence agency and a pioneer in the movement to end domestic violence.</p>

									<p><span class="cursive" style="font-size:24px;">Dear Friends,</span></p>
									<p>My name is Laura Ladd and a number of years ago I was a juror in a first degree murder case that involved domestic violence. The case left me heartbroken and wondering about the victim and the challenges she faced. I decided to do my part to support women who struggle to connect with resources that allow them to move beyond crisis.</p>
									<p>I reached out to <a href="http://www.respondinc.org">RESPOND</a> - New England&apos;s first domestic violence agency. Every year, RESPOND helps over 10,000 women, men, and teens from communities throughout Greater Boston and beyond, regardless of their ethnicity, orientation, or gender. For victims of domestic violence, the daily struggle to survive is saddled with challenges like abuse and psychological trauma. It makes you wonder which issue would be the priority if you had so many to manage all alone? Sadly, some have no choice but to stay with an abusive partner because it ensures a roof over their head and their children&apos;s. I am moved by the way RESPOND saves lives, and for this reason, I&apos;m reaching out to you to ask for your support.</p>
									<p>On Saturday, May 7th, my friends and I are hosting Down &amp; Derby, our 7th annual community fundraiser.  Down &amp; Derby is a Kentucky Derby themed event to raise funds for RESPOND. The event will be held at Serafina and we are expecting 350 young professionals from Greater Boston in attendance. Last year, Down &amp; Derby raised over $11,000. The event is sophisticated, yet fun, to reflect the traditional sporting event&apos;s stature, and the message is to support survivors of domestic violence right here in Boston.</p>
									<p>We look forward to seeing you at Serafina, and appreciate your support.</p>
									<p><span class="cursive" style="font-size:24px;">Sincerely,</span></p>
									<p><span class="contentHeader" style="font-size:24px;">Laura Ladd</span></p>
									<p>Friend and Volunteer of RESPOND</p>

Its work began in the early 1970s, when four Somerville, Massachusetts women started a grassroots effort to support victims of domestic violence by opening their own homes as safe havens for women fleeing abuse. In 1974, these "founding mothers" formed RESPOND. For over 40 years RESPOND has provided life-saving shelter, support services, training and education to more than 100,000 members of the community. Services are free and confidential, and available to all survivors of domestic abuse.</p>
